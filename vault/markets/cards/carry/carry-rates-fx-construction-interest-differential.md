## Q
Walk through the mechanics of an FX carry trade — funding currency and
target currency — and state exactly what determines its return if the
exchange rate does not move at all over the holding period. Why is this
outcome not the strategy's typical realized return over a long sample?

## A
**Borrow (go short) the low-interest-rate "funding" currency and use the
proceeds to buy (go long) the high-interest-rate "target" currency**, for
example borrowing yen at a near-zero rate and holding Australian dollars at
a higher rate. If the exchange rate is exactly unchanged at the end of the
holding period, the trade earns precisely the interest rate differential
between the two currencies — pay the low funding rate, collect the higher
target rate, keep the spread. This unchanged-price return is the trade's
carry, by the same definition as any other carry position.

Over a long sample, the realized return is not simply this differential
because the exchange rate does move — but, per the forward premium puzzle,
it does not move in the direction (or by the amount) that would offset the
differential on average. So the long-run average realized return tends to
sit close to, and in many samples above, the pure interest-differential
carry, rather than netting to zero the way covered-interest-parity
arbitrage or a naive application of UIP would suggest. The gap between "what
carry alone would deliver" and "what's actually realized" is exactly the
forward-premium-puzzle drift, plus the occasional large negative
observations from a funding-currency unwind that make the distribution
negatively skewed rather than a free, riskless spread.

请梳理一次 FX carry 交易的机制——融资货币和目标货币——并说明如果持有期内汇
率完全不变,这笔交易的收益究竟由什么决定。为什么这个结果并不是这个策略在
长样本上的典型实现收益?

## A zh
**借入(做空)低利率的"融资"货币,用所得资金买入(做多)高利率的"目标"货
币**,比如以接近零的利率借入日元,持有利率更高的澳元。如果持有期结束时汇
率完全不变,这笔交易恰好赚到两种货币之间的利率差——支付较低的融资利率,收
取较高的目标货币利率,赚取中间的差额。这个"价格不变时的收益"就是这笔交易
的 carry,和任何其他 carry 头寸的定义完全一样。

在一个长样本上,实现收益并不只是这个利率差,因为汇率确实会变动——但根据远
期溢价之谜,汇率平均而言并不会朝能够抵消这个利率差的方向(或幅度)变动。
所以长期平均实现收益往往接近、在许多样本里甚至高于纯利率差 carry,而不是
像抛补利率平价套利或对 UIP 的简单套用所暗示的那样归零。"单纯 carry 应该带
来什么"和"实际实现了什么"之间的差距,正是远期溢价之谜带来的那部分漂移,再
加上偶尔出现的、来自融资货币逼空的大额负收益观测——这些负收益让整个分布呈
现负偏,而不是一个免费的、无风险的利差。
