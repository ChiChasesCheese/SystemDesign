## Q
A long-only equity fund returns 8% in a year when the risk-free rate is 2%, the market returns 8%, and the fund's beta to the market is 1.2. Decompose that 8% into the return attributable to bearing systematic risk (the risk premium owed for its beta) and the return attributable to skill (alpha). Did the fund actually "beat the market"?

## A
**Risk premium is compensation for exposure to a systematic risk that cannot be diversified away; beta measures how much of that risk an asset carries; alpha is whatever return is left over once the risk premium owed for that beta is subtracted out.**

CAPM says the return owed just for holding this fund's amount of market risk is Rf + β(Rm − Rf) = 2% + 1.2 × (8% − 2%) = 2% + 7.2% = 9.2%. The fund actually returned 8%, which is *below* that figure, so alpha = 8% − 9.2% = **−1.2%**. The manager did not beat the market — they carried more market risk than the market itself (β = 1.2 vs the market's β = 1), earned roughly the return that extra risk normally pays, and then underperformed even that number. "The market went up 8% and so did I" sounds like success; decomposed by beta, it's negative alpha. Alpha is the only piece of return that is evidence of skill (or luck) rather than of risk-bearing, and — summed across all investors before costs — it is zero-sum, since every dollar of alpha is another investor's dollar of shortfall.

某只纯多头股票基金某年收益 8%，同期无风险利率为 2%，市场收益也是 8%，该基金相对市场的 beta 为 1.2。把这 8% 拆成"承担系统性风险应得的补偿"（即 beta 对应的风险溢价，risk premium）和"体现管理人技能的部分"（alpha）。这只基金真的跑赢市场了吗？

## A zh
**风险溢价（risk premium）是对承担某种无法分散掉的系统性风险的补偿；beta 衡量一项资产承担了多少这种风险；alpha 则是扣掉该 beta 应得的风险溢价之后剩下的那部分收益。**

按 CAPM，仅凭这只基金所承担的市场风险水平，"应得"的收益是 Rf + β(Rm − Rf) = 2% + 1.2 × (8% − 2%) = 2% + 7.2% = 9.2%。基金实际收益是 8%，**低于**这个数字，所以 alpha = 8% − 9.2% = **−1.2%**。这位管理人并没有跑赢市场——他只是比市场本身（β = 1）承担了更多的市场风险（β = 1.2），赚到了这份额外风险大致该赚的收益，然后连这个数都没达到。"市场涨了 8%，我也涨了 8%"听起来像是成功；但按 beta 拆解后，这其实是负 alpha。alpha 是收益里唯一能证明技能（或运气）而非单纯承担风险的部分——而且在扣除费用前，所有投资者的 alpha 加总为零和：你赚的每一块钱 alpha，都是另一个投资者少赚的那一块钱。
