Trade data and book data fail differently under packet loss. Losing one trade message means one missing observation — every other trade print is still individually {{c1::self-contained and correctly interpretable}}. Losing one book delta message is worse in kind, not just in degree: because every subsequent delta is applied {{c2::on top of the state built by all prior deltas}}, one dropped packet leaves the reconstructed book permanently wrong from that point forward, and the corruption propagates into every feature computed from book state — {{c3::order-book imbalance, queue-position estimates, quoted spread, passive-fill probability}} — without raising any error, since applying a delta to an already-wrong base is still a well-formed operation. The only mechanism that catches it is a {{c4::continuously running sequence-number gap check}} that forces a resync from a fresh snapshot the instant a gap appears — a periodic audit is not enough, because by the time it runs, every downstream number since the gap has already been silently wrong.

成交数据和盘口数据在丢包时的失效方式不同。丢失一条成交报文只是少了一个观测值——其他每一笔成交打印依然各自{{c1::自包含、可以被正确解读}}。丢失一条盘口增量报文则是性质上更糟，而不只是程度更糟：因为每一条后续增量都是叠加在{{c2::所有先前增量所构建出的状态之上}}应用的，一个丢弃的数据包会让重建出的盘口从那一刻起永久性地出错，而且这种损坏会传播进每一个基于盘口状态计算的特征——{{c3::订单簿失衡、队列位置估计、报价点差、被动成交概率}}——却不会触发任何报错，因为把一条增量应用在一个已经错误的基础状态之上，依然是一次格式良好的操作。唯一能抓住它的机制是一个{{c4::持续运行的序列号缺口检测}}，一旦出现缺口就强制从最新快照重新同步——周期性审计是不够的，因为等它运行的时候，自缺口出现以来的每一个下游数字早就已经悄悄错了。
