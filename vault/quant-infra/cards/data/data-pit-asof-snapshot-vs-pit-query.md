## Q
Team A rebuilds their research universe by taking a full snapshot of the fundamentals database every Friday night and reading the nearest prior snapshot for any backtest date. Team B stores every vintage with a knowledge date and queries `knowledge_date <= t` directly. Both claim to be "point-in-time." What is the actual difference, and when does it matter?

## A
**A snapshot table only has the resolution of its snapshot cadence; a true as-of (bitemporal) query has the resolution of the underlying knowledge-date events.** Team A's Friday snapshot answers "what did the database look like last Friday," which is a fine approximation for a slow-moving fact but is wrong by up to six days for anything that changed mid-week — a Tuesday earnings restatement is invisible until the following Friday's snapshot, so a Wednesday-Thursday backtest date sees stale data, and a snapshot taken *after* a Friday restatement leaks it into dates that predate the restatement by up to four days.

Team B's query is correct at the granularity the vendor actually reports knowledge dates — typically to the day, sometimes to the timestamp — so it has no such window. The trade-off is cost and complexity: snapshotting is cheap to build (dump the current table on a schedule) and cheap to query (one table per week), while true as-of storage requires every write to be additive and every read to reconstruct state via a filter-and-latest-per-key query, which is more expensive at scale. Snapshotting is an acceptable shortcut only when the snapshot cadence is much finer than the fact's real update frequency (e.g., daily snapshots of prices, which change every trading day anyway) — it silently reintroduces leakage or staleness the moment that stops being true.

A 团队每周五晚上对基本面数据库做一次完整快照，回测查询任意日期时读取最近的前一份快照。B 团队为每个版本记录知晓日期，直接用 `knowledge_date <= t` 查询。两个团队都声称自己是"point-in-time"。实际区别是什么？什么时候这个区别会造成影响？

## A zh
**快照表的分辨率只有快照周期那么细；真正的 as-of（双时态）查询的分辨率取决于底层知晓日期事件本身。** A 团队的周五快照回答的是"上周五数据库长什么样"，对于变化缓慢的事实这是个不错的近似，但对周中发生变化的任何事实，误差可达六天——周二的财报重述在下一个周五的快照之前是不可见的，所以周三到周四的回测日期会看到过时数据；而如果快照是在周五重述**之后**拍摄的，又会把这条重述泄露给早于重述最多四天的那些日期。

B 团队的查询在供应商实际记录知晓日期的粒度上是正确的——通常精确到天，有时精确到时间戳——因此不存在这样的窗口。代价是成本和复杂度：做快照构建便宜（按计划把当前表原样导出），查询也便宜（每周一张表）；而真正的 as-of 存储要求每次写入都是追加式的，每次读取都要通过"过滤后取每个键最新值"的查询来重建状态，在规模化后开销更大。只有当快照周期远细于事实的真实更新频率时（例如每日对价格做快照，反正价格本来每个交易日都变），做快照才是可接受的捷径——一旦这个前提不再成立，它就会悄悄重新引入信息泄露或数据过时的问题。
