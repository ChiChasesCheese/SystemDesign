A stock does a 2-for-1 split on day T (each holder now has twice the shares, price roughly halves) and, unrelated, pays a $1 cash dividend on day T+90. To make the pre-split, pre-dividend price series comparable to today's price scale, an **adjustment factor** is built by walking backward from the most recent date and, at each corporate-action date, multiplying every price *before* that date by a per-event factor: for the split, prices before T are multiplied by {{c1::0.5}} (shares outstanding, conversely, are multiplied by {{c2::2}} to keep market cap invariant); for the cash dividend, prices before T+90 are multiplied by {{c3::(1 − dividend / pre-dividend close price)}}, a factor just under 1. Because factors are applied cumulatively walking backward through every action in the security's history, the adjustment factor for a date far in the past is the {{c4::product of every subsequent event's factor}} — which is also why a single corrected or newly-discovered corporate action can silently rewrite the *entire* historical adjusted-price series back to that instrument's first trading day, not just the period around the event.

某股票在第 T 天进行 2 股拆 1 股（每位持有人的股数翻倍，价格大致减半），此外在第 T+90 天派发了 1 美元的现金股息，两者不相关。为了让拆分前、除息前的价格序列与今天的价格量纲可比，需要构建一个**复权因子（adjustment factor）**：从最近的日期往回走，在每一个公司行为发生日，把**该日之前**的每个价格乘以该事件对应的一个因子：对于拆分，T 之前的价格要乘以 {{c1::0.5}}（反过来，流通股数要乘以 {{c2::2}} 以保持市值不变）；对于现金股息，T+90 之前的价格要乘以 {{c3::(1 − 股息 / 除息前收盘价)}}，一个略小于 1 的因子。由于因子是沿着该证券整段历史往回走、逐个事件累乘得到的，某个遥远过去日期的复权因子等于{{c4::之后每一个事件因子的连乘积}}——这也是为什么一次公司行为的修正或新发现，会悄悄改写从该标的第一个交易日开始的**整段**复权价格历史，而不只是事件前后那一小段。
