## Q
"Backtest a strategy on the S&P 500 as of 2010" — a colleague implements this by taking today's S&P 500 constituent list and pulling each ticker's history back through 2010. Why is this a materially different, and easier, backtest than one run on the actual 2010 membership, even though both are "the S&P 500"?

## A
**The index is not a fixed set of 500 companies — it is reconstituted continuously, with roughly 20-30 additions and removals a year** (S&P Dow Jones Indices runs quarterly rebalances plus ad hoc changes for M&A, bankruptcy, and eligibility). Over 15 years that is on the order of 300-450 changes, meaning today's membership and 2010's membership overlap only partially.

Using today's list for a 2010 backtest does two things simultaneously, both of which flatter results:
- **It drops every company that was in the index in 2010 but was later removed** — removals are disproportionately companies that shrank, were acquired below their index-eligible value, or went bankrupt (Lehman-style events), so this silently repeats survivorship bias at the index-membership level, not just the "still trading" level.
- **It adds every company that was not yet in the index in 2010 but was added later**, typically *because* it grew large and successful enough to qualify — injecting future winners into a universe the strategy is credited with having "selected" in the past.

A genuinely point-in-time backtest needs a **PIT index membership table** — for each date, the exact constituent list as it stood that day, sourced from the index provider's historical reconstitution records, not derived by rewinding today's list. This is why "the current S&P 500 in 2010" and "the S&P 500 as it actually was in 2010" are different universes and produce different, non-comparable backtests.

"在 2010 年的标普 500 上回测一个策略"——一位同事的实现方式是取今天的标普 500 成分股清单，把每只股票的历史数据往回拉到 2010 年。尽管两者都叫"标普 500"，为什么这实际上是一个明显不同、也明显更容易做出好结果的回测？

## A zh
**指数并不是一组固定不变的 500 家公司——它在持续重构，每年大约有 20-30 次调入调出**（标普道琼斯指数公司每季度定期调仓，再加上因并购、破产、资格变化触发的临时调整）。15 年下来大约是 300-450 次变动，意味着今天的成分股和 2010 年的成分股只是部分重叠。

用今天的清单做 2010 年的回测同时做了两件都会美化结果的事：
- **删掉了 2010 年在指数里、之后被剔除的每一家公司**——被剔除的公司里，因规模萎缩、被低价收购、或破产（雷曼式事件）而出局的比例明显偏高，所以这在指数成分层面又一次悄悄重演了存活者偏差，而不仅仅是"现在还在交易"层面。
- **加入了 2010 年还不在指数里、之后才被纳入的每一家公司**，而它们之所以被纳入，通常正是因为后来成长得足够大、足够成功才达标——这相当于把未来的赢家塞进了一个策略被认为"在过去就已选中"的股票池里。

一个真正做到点时的回测需要一张 **PIT 指数成分表**——对每一个日期，给出该日实际生效的准确成分股清单，来源于指数提供商的历史重构记录，而不是把今天的清单往回倒推。这就是为什么"2010 年的当前标普 500"和"2010 年真实的标普 500"是不同的股票池，会产出不同、不可比较的回测结果。
