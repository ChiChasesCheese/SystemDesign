## Q
A trading desk reports "we beat VWAP by 3 bps on average this quarter" as their headline execution-quality metric. A separate, less-publicized report shows the same desk's executions averaged 40 bps worse than arrival price over the same period. Both numbers can be true at once — what does that tell you about what a benchmark choice actually does to a TCA report?

## A
**The benchmark isn't a neutral yardstick — it's a choice that determines what gets measured as a cost at all, and a desk (consciously or not) tends to look best on whichever benchmark absorbs the most of what it actually did.** VWAP as a benchmark only asks "did my average price track the day's volume-weighted average?" — it says nothing about whether the day itself moved against the order, and if the desk's own trading is a meaningful fraction of the day's volume, the desk's trades are baked into the VWAP print it's being measured against (see the companion card on this endogeneity). Beating VWAP by 3 bps can coexist with a terrible arrival-price outcome whenever the stock trended hard during execution — the VWAP benchmark absorbed the trend, so the desk's participation in that trend doesn't show up as a cost against it.

Arrival price asks a stricter, more literal question: "what did the PM's decision actually end up costing, from the moment they decided to trade?" It charges the desk for every source of cost — delay before starting, the desk's own market impact, and any adverse drift during execution — with nothing external to hide behind. The two benchmarks are not approximations of the same thing measured slightly differently; they answer different questions, and a desk that only reports the one it looks good on is (deliberately or not) choosing which question gets asked. This is exactly why a TCA program that lets the trading desk pick its own benchmark is not really measuring execution quality — it's measuring whichever number the desk would prefer to be judged by.

## Q zh
某交易台把"本季度我们的执行平均跑赢 VWAP 3 个基点"作为衡量执行质量的头条指标来汇报。而另一份不太公开的报告显示，同一交易台同一时期的执行，相对到达价平均差了 40 个基点。这两个数字可以同时为真——这说明基准的选择实际上对一份 TCA 报告做了什么？

## A zh
**基准不是一把中立的尺子——它是一个决定"到底什么会被算作成本"的选择，而交易台（无论是否有意）往往会在最能吸收掉自己实际所作所为的那个基准上看起来表现最好。** VWAP 作为基准，问的只是"我的平均成交价有没有跟上当天的成交量加权均价？"——它对当天本身是否朝对订单不利的方向移动只字不提，而且如果这个交易台自己的交易量占当天成交量的相当比例，那么交易台自己的成交就已经被揉进了它被拿来衡量的那个 VWAP 数字里（见关于这种内生性的配套卡片）。只要在执行期间股票大幅趋势性变动，"跑赢 VWAP 3 个基点"完全可以和一个糟糕的到达价结果同时成立——VWAP 基准吸收了这段趋势，所以交易台在这段趋势中的参与，不会作为成本显现出来。

到达价问的是一个更严格、更字面意义上的问题："从基金经理做出决策那一刻起，这个决定最终实际付出了多少代价？"它把每一个成本来源都记在交易台头上：开始执行前的延迟、交易台自身的市场冲击、以及执行期间的任何不利漂移，没有任何外部因素可以拿来当挡箭牌。这两个基准并不是对同一件事略有不同的近似衡量；它们回答的是不同的问题，而一个只汇报自己表现好的那个基准的交易台，无论是否故意，实际上是在替别人决定该问哪个问题。这正是为什么一个允许交易台自己挑选基准的 TCA 项目，其实并不是在衡量执行质量——它衡量的是交易台自己希望被拿来评判的那个数字。
