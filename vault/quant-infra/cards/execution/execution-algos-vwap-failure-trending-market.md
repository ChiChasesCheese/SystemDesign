## Q
You need to buy a large position over a full trading day, and the stock trends steadily upward all day on news that broke near the open. A VWAP algo executes the order and reports a VWAP slippage of only 2 bps — it looks like a clean execution. Why might the PM who gave you the order still be angry, and what did the choice of algorithm actually cost them?

## A
**A VWAP algo did exactly what it was built to do — match the day's volume-weighted average price — and that is precisely the problem in a trending market: the benchmark itself trended against the order all day, so tracking it closely still means paying a steadily rising price throughout.** VWAP schedules trading proportional to the historical/predicted volume curve, blind to price level or price direction — it has no mechanism that says "front-load because the price is running away from us." In a stock trending up all day, later volume (afternoon) trades at higher prices than earlier volume (morning), and the VWAP benchmark itself is pulled up by that same drift — so an algo that faithfully spreads the buy order across the day, matching volume shape, ends up paying the rising price right along with the rising benchmark. The 2 bps of VWAP slippage is real and small, but it's measuring the wrong thing: it compares the execution to a benchmark that itself absorbed the entire day's adverse trend.

**What actually got destroyed is the gap between arrival price (the price when the PM decided to buy, near the open, before the trend played out) and the average execution price** — likely tens of bps worse, not 2. An arrival-price/implementation-shortfall algorithm, sensitive to urgency and the fact that prices were moving away from the order, would have front-loaded execution to buy more near the open, exactly when arrival-price cost was lowest, instead of dutifully spreading size into progressively worse afternoon prices. This is the general failure mode: **VWAP optimizes for a benchmark that can itself be a trending, moving target, and looking good against a moving target is not the same as minimizing what the order actually cost the fund.**

你需要在一整个交易日内买入一个大仓位，而这只股票由于开盘附近爆出的新闻，全天持续上涨。一个 VWAP 算法执行了这笔订单，报告显示 VWAP 滑点只有 2 个基点——看起来是一次干净利落的执行。为什么给你下单的基金经理仍然可能很生气？算法的选择实际上让他付出了什么代价？

## A zh
**VWAP 算法确实做到了它被设计要做的事——匹配当天的成交量加权平均价——而这恰恰是趋势市场中的问题所在：基准本身全天都在朝对订单不利的方向趋势性移动，所以紧贴基准，意味着全天都在稳步支付越来越高的价格。** VWAP 按历史/预测的成交量曲线来安排交易节奏，对价格水平或价格方向是"盲"的——它没有任何机制会说"因为价格正在跑远，所以要前置"。在一只全天上涨的股票上，较晚的成交量（下午）比较早的成交量（上午）价格更高，而 VWAP 基准本身也被同样的这波上涨拉高了——所以一个忠实地把买单按成交量形状铺满全天的算法，最终会随着基准一起，付出不断上涨的价格。2 个基点的 VWAP 滑点是真实的、也确实很小，但它衡量的是错误的东西：它把执行结果和一个本身就吸收了全天不利趋势的基准做比较。

**真正被摧毁的是到达价（arrival price，基金经理在开盘附近做出买入决策那一刻的价格，趋势还没展开时）和平均成交价之间的差距**——很可能差了几十个基点，而不是 2 个。一个对紧迫性、以及价格正在远离订单这一事实敏感的到达价/到达价缺口算法，本会把执行前置，在开盘附近、也就是到达价成本最低的时候多买一些，而不是老老实实地把量铺进价格越来越差的下午盘。这是一种普遍的失败模式：**VWAP 优化的是一个本身可能就是趋势性、会移动的目标，而相对一个移动目标表现良好，并不等于把这笔订单给基金实际造成的成本降到最低。**
