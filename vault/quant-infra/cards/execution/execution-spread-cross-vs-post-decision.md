## Q
Your signal has a half-life of about 30 seconds — most of its predictive power decays within half a minute of generation. A separate signal you run has a multi-day holding period and no urgency. For each, would you cross the spread with a marketable order or post a limit order and wait, and what does the wrong choice cost you in each case?

## A
**Crossing the spread buys certainty of execution now; posting buys a cheaper price at the risk of never executing — the right choice is set by whether your edge decays faster than you can reasonably expect to wait.**

- **The 30-second-half-life signal should cross.** If you post a passive limit order and wait even a few seconds for it to fill, a large fraction of the edge that justified the trade is already gone by the time you're filled — and if the order doesn't fill at all, you've paid the full cost of a wrong call with zero of the benefit. The cost of *not* crossing here is the far larger one: near-total loss of the signal's value to decay, which dwarfs the spread you'd save. Pay the spread; take the fill.
- **The multi-day signal should post.** There is no meaningful decay over the seconds-to-minutes it might take a passive order to fill, so paying the spread buys nothing — it's a pure, avoidable cost stacked onto a trade you have no urgency reason to rush. The risk of posting is non-execution (price runs away before you fill) and adverse selection (you mostly get filled when the market is moving against you), but for a slow signal those risks are small and manageable relative to the spread saved, especially if the order can be worked patiently or re-priced as conditions change.

The general rule this generalizes to: **spread cost is fixed regardless of your holding period, but the cost of waiting to avoid it scales with how fast your edge decays** — so the crossover point between "cross" and "post" is exactly where the expected decay of the signal over the likely wait time equals the spread you'd save by being patient.

## Q zh
你有一个信号，其预测力的半衰期大约是 30 秒——生成后半分钟内大部分预测力就衰减掉了。你还运行另一个信号，持有期是好几天，没有紧迫性。对这两种情况，你会用可成交单穿越价差，还是挂限价单等待？做错选择在各自情形下分别要付出什么代价？

## A zh
**穿越价差换来的是当下立刻成交的确定性；挂单换来的是更便宜的价格，但要承担永远等不到成交的风险——正确的选择取决于你的信号衰减速度是否快于你能合理等待的时间。**

- **半衰期 30 秒的信号应该穿越价差成交。** 如果你挂一个被动限价单，哪怕只等几秒钟才成交，等到成交的时候，支撑这笔交易的大部分优势可能已经消失了——如果订单根本没成交，你付出了一个错误判断的全部代价，却一点收益都没拿到。这里"不穿越"的代价才是大得多的那个：信号价值因衰减而近乎完全损失，远远超过省下来的那点价差。付价差，拿成交。
- **多日持有期的信号应该挂单。** 被动委托可能需要几秒到几分钟才成交，这段时间内没有值得一提的衰减，所以付价差买不到任何东西——这纯粹是一笔可以避免、却硬加在一笔并无紧迫理由的交易上的成本。挂单的风险是不成交（价格在你成交前就跑掉了）和逆向选择（大多数时候你被成交时市场正朝对你不利的方向走），但对一个慢信号来说，相对于省下的价差，这些风险很小、也可控，尤其是当委托可以被耐心地执行、或随行情变化重新报价时。

由此得到的一般规律是：**价差成本与你的持有期无关、是固定的，但为了避开它而等待所付出的代价，会随着你的优势衰减速度而变化**——所以"穿越"和"挂单"之间的分界点，恰好就是信号在可能的等待时间内的预期衰减，等于耐心等待所能省下的价差的那个点。
