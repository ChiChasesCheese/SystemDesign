## Q
A backtest assumes a flat 5 bps transaction cost per trade, taken from a textbook years ago. The desk has since paper-traded and live-traded the strategy for a year, and every fill carries a recorded decision price, arrival price, and average fill price. How should that fill history actually change the backtest's cost assumption, and why is this a better source than the original literature number?

## A
**Every recorded fill is a labeled data point that reveals what this specific strategy, in this specific market, at this specific size, actually paid — which is a far better estimate than a generic literature constant that reflects nobody's particular order flow.** The three prices attached to each fill do specific jobs: the gap between decision price and arrival price measures realized delay cost; the gap between arrival price and average fill price measures realized spread-plus-impact; and aggregating these gaps across many fills, grouped by market and by trading scenario (e.g., normal-liquidity days versus stressed ones), produces empirically measured spread and impact figures rather than assumed ones.

The mechanism is a closed loop, not a one-time correction: fills get aggregated into a **cost profile** — typically kept as separate fee, spread, and impact components rather than one blended number (see the impact leaf's cloze card on why that split matters) — and that measured profile replaces the flat assumed cost in subsequent backtests. This matters for two concrete reasons. First, a flat literature number is usually wrong in a specific, knowable direction for a specific market — e.g., understating true cost in a market with wide realistic spreads, or overstating it in one that's more liquid than the literature assumed — and only your own fills can tell you which way and by how much. Second, and more importantly, it makes the backtest's cost assumption **self-correcting as conditions change**: if the strategy's own trading starts moving the market more as it scales, or as liquidity in the traded names shifts, the next round of aggregated fills captures that automatically, rather than requiring someone to remember to go back and re-derive a cost assumption from a paper. A backtest that never updates its cost model from live fills is, in effect, still trusting an assumption that has had no chance to be falsified by the strategy's own trading.

一个回测假设每笔交易固定收取 5 个基点的交易成本，这个数字是多年前从一本教材里抄来的。此后这个策略已经做了一年的模拟交易和实盘交易，每一笔成交都记录了决策价、到达价、平均成交价三个价格。这段成交历史应该如何真正改变回测的成本假设？为什么这比原始的文献数字更可靠？

## A zh
**每一笔记录下来的成交都是一个带标签的数据点，揭示的是这个具体策略、在这个具体市场、以这个具体规模，实际付出了多少——这远比一个反映不了任何具体资金流的通用文献常数更靠谱。** 每笔成交附带的三个价格各司其职：决策价和到达价之间的差距，衡量的是实际发生的延迟成本；到达价和平均成交价之间的差距，衡量的是实际发生的价差加冲击成本；把这些差距在大量成交上聚合起来，按市场和交易情景分组（比如正常流动性的日子 vs 承压的日子），就能得到实测的价差和冲击数字，而不是假设出来的。

这个机制是一个闭环，而不是一次性的纠正：成交被聚合成一份**成本档案（cost profile）**——通常保留手续费、价差、冲击三个独立分量，而不是一个混合数字（原因见 impact 那一支的填空卡片）——这份实测档案会取代回测中原先假设的平摊成本。这一点有两个具体的意义。第一，一个来自文献的固定数字，对某个具体市场往往会在一个特定、可预知的方向上是错的——比如在一个实际价差很宽的市场里低估了真实成本，或者在一个比文献假设更流动的市场里高估了成本——只有你自己的成交才能告诉你偏差的方向和大小。第二，也更重要的是，这让回测的成本假设变得**能随行情条件变化而自我修正**：如果策略自身的交易随着规模扩大对市场的影响变大了，或者所交易标的的流动性发生了变化，下一轮聚合的成交会自动捕捉到这一点，而不需要有人记得回头从某篇论文里重新推导一个成本假设。一个从不用实盘成交来更新其成本模型的回测，实际上仍然在信任一个从未有机会被自己策略的真实交易证伪的假设。
