## Q
A long-short equity strategy passes the deflated-Sharpe gate with DSR = 0.97 on its reported daily return series. A subsequent audit finds that in an average month, 52% of the strategy's short positions were in stocks with no borrow actually available that day. What did the passing DSR verify, and what did it never check?

## A
**DSR is a statistical test on the return series that was handed to it — it operates entirely on the numbers already in the P&L, and has no way to see how those numbers were generated.** A DSR of 0.97 says that, given the reported returns' skew, kurtosis, sample length, and the number of trials searched, the observed Sharpe is very unlikely to be a fluke of the search process. That is a real, useful statement, but it is scoped to *significance of the P&L as computed* — it says nothing about whether every leg contributing to that P&L was actually executable.

A short position in a name with no borrow available cannot actually be opened — the "return" the backtest attributes to it is fictional, computed as if the trade happened when it couldn't have. If 52% of short legs in a typical month fall into this category, then a large share of the return series DSR just certified as "statistically real" was never a tradable book to begin with — the statistic is doing exactly what it's designed to do (distinguish signal from search-driven luck) on an input that was already wrong before any statistics were applied. This is why executability checks — borrow availability, realistic fill assumptions, capacity/impact limits — have to run as a **separate gate**, independent of and in addition to DSR/PBO: a strategy can be simultaneously statistically real on paper and not a strategy anyone could actually run.

## Q zh
一个多空股票策略在其报告的日频收益序列上，以 DSR = 0.97 通过了 deflated-Sharpe 闸门。后续审计发现，在一个典型月份里，该策略 52% 的空头持仓所对应的股票，当天实际上根本借不到券。这个通过了的 DSR 验证了什么？它从未检查过什么？

## A zh
**DSR 是对喂给它的那段收益序列做的统计检验——它完全在已经存在于损益（P&L）里的数字上运作，没有任何办法看到这些数字是怎么被算出来的。** DSR = 0.97 说的是：给定报告收益的偏度、峰度、样本长度，以及搜索过的试验次数，观测到的 Sharpe 极不可能是搜索过程碰运气产生的。这是一个真实、有用的陈述，但它的范围仅限于"**已计算出的** P&L 在统计上是否显著"——它对构成这个 P&L 的每一条腿是否真的可执行完全没有回答。

一个当天根本借不到券的空头仓位实际上根本无法建仓——回测归到它头上的"收益"是虚构的，是按照这笔交易发生了来计算的，而它本不可能发生。如果一个典型月份里 52% 的空头腿都属于这种情况，那么 DSR 刚刚认证为"统计上真实"的这段收益序列，很大一部分从一开始就不是一本可交易的账——这个统计量正在它被设计要做的事情上（把信号和搜索带来的运气区分开）正确地运作，但它作用的输入，在任何统计学介入之前就已经是错的了。这就是为什么可执行性检查——融券可得性、真实的成交假设、容量/冲击限制——必须作为一道**独立的闸门**运行，独立于、且叠加在 DSR/PBO 之上：一个策略完全可以在纸面上统计为真，却根本不是任何人能真正运行起来的策略。
